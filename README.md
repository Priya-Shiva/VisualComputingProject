# Visual Computing Project
This repository is for the course "2IMV10 - Visual computing project" offered during 2018-2019 (Quartile 3) at Eindhoven University of Technology. Here, we created a photo collage generating application using Python. Given a set of photos, this web application will provide interactive collage making functionalities.
